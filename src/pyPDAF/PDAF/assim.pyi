    """Distribute analysis state vector to an array.

    The primary purpose of this function is to distribute
    the analysis state vector to the model.
    This is attained by the user-supplied function
    :func:`py__distribute_state_pdaf`.
    One can also use this function to get the state vector
    for other purposes, e.g. to write the state vector to a file.

    In this function, the user-supplied function
    :func:`py__next_observation_pdaf` is executed
    to specify the number of forecast time steps
    until the next assimilation step.
    One can also use the user-supplied function to
    end the assimilation.

    In an online DA system, this function also execute
    the user-supplied function :func:`py__prepoststep_state_pdaf`,
    when this function is first called. The purpose of this design
    is to call this function right after :func:`pyPDAF.PDAF.init`
    to process the initial ensemble before using it to
    initialse model forecast. This user-supplied function
    will not be called afterwards.

    This function is also used in flexible parallel system
    where the number of ensemble members are greater than
    the parallel model tasks. In this case, this function
    is called multiple times to distribute the analysis ensemble.

    User-supplied function are executed in the following sequence:

        1. py__prepoststep_state_pdaf
           (only in online system when first called)
        2. py__distribute_state_pdaf
        3. py__next_observation_pdaf

    Parameters
    ----------
    steps : int
        Flag and number of time steps
    doexit : int
        Whether to exit from forecasts
    py__next_observation_pdaf : Callable
        Provide information on next forecast
    py__distribute_state_pdaf : Callable
        Routine to distribute a state vector
    py__prepoststep_pdaf : Callable
        User supplied pre/poststep routine
    outflag : int
        Status flag

    Returns
    -------
    steps : int
        Flag and number of time steps
    time : float
        current model time
    doexit : int
        Whether to exit from forecasts
    outflag : int
        Status flag
