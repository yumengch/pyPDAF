pyPDAF - A Python interface to Parallel Data Assimilation Framework
======

pyPDAF is a Python interface to the `Parallel Data Assimilation Framwork (PDAF) <http://pdaf.awi.de/trac/wiki>`_ library written in Fortran. The latest pyPDAF supports PDAF-V2.0.

With a variety of packages in Python, it allows a simpler coding style for user-supplied functions, such as I/O of observations and post-processing. It can also benefit many Python-based numerical models with parallel and efficient data assimilation capability.
